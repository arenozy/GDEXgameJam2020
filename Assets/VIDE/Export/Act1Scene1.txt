Act one, a place of new beginnings and possibility! Oh how excited you must feel, Director! Your first production opening in just a few days, I’m sure you have everything ready. 
#COMMENT#
Your actors know all their lines, right?
#COMMENT#
The lights are timed properly?
#COMMENT#
The props accounted for?
#COMMENT#
Now that I’m thinking about it why don’t we just go check on how things are going…

#COMMENT#
There they are! Your two leading men.
#COMMENT#
Thomas, the wise, experienced thespian. He owns Avalon Community Theatre, does he not?
#COMMENT#
And Daniel! The wayward youth in desperate need of guidance. You may want to keep an eye on him, Director.
#COMMENT#
I imagine your two leading ladies are backstage.
#COMMENT#
McKenzie, the aspiring actress pursuing her dreams - and a degree - in the theatre.
#COMMENT#
Along with Samantha, coincidentally Thomas’ niece, believe it or not..
#COMMENT#
And… Oh. Oh my listen to me prattle whilst we’ve got quite the argument brewing… Director look. Thomas and Daniel look positively furious with one another, and not in a method acting sort of way.
#COMMENT#
I would get involved if I were you, it is your job, after all. Go on, get in there! So much to do, so little time… Good luck!
