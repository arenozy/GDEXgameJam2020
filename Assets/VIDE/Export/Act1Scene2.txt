How will the audience in the back rows know the pain and suffering of the Cratchits if they cannot hear the pain and suffering in your lines?

Well maybe that’s not what I want. Not all of us wanna waste our lives away in some dusty old theatre.

Thomas, Dan’s right. You can’t keep stopping rehearsal whenever you want to. I’m the director. It’s my job to stop either of you when something needs changing.
#COMMENT#
Daniel, Thomas is only trying to help. A few quick tips never hurt anyone. Try to be more open to his experience and knowledge.

I see neither of you are willing to listen to my expertise.

When the play fails, I won’t be the one to blame! I will return tomorrow hopeful you’ve learnt some respect!

Uh, Director? Before you go can you check the storage room? Samantha said she heard things moving around in there.
