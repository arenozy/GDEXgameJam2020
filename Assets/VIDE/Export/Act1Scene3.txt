Oh… Hello there. I don’t believe I’ve tried to introduce myself to you. Not that I suppose you can even see me… No one can, you know.
#COMMENT#
Quite inconvenient when you’re trying to get someone’s attention.

A GGG... GHOST!

You can?! Well that’s certainly a pleasant surprise! I’ve been here for decades now and it seems not enough people believe in ghosts anymore.

Hm? Oh you cannot see a ghost unless you believe in ghosts. Which… I suppose must mean you believe in ghosts!
#COMMENT#
Oh this is wonderful, it’s been decades since I spoke with anyone.

Please don’t be frightened! You’re the first person who’s been able to see me in some time.
#COMMENT#
I really didn’t mean to startle you. I’ve just gotten used to being unseen and unheard. Only those who believe in ghosts can see them, you know.

You could help me!

If your play’s a success, perhaps I can finally move on!

The play’s going to fail. No one can get along.

How can I make sure the play succeeds?

Why should I help you?

If you truly believed that, why are you still here? 
#COMMENT#
Please, there must be some way you can encourage your actors to cooperate together.

Well, I imagine you’ll need to speak with your cast, find any misplaced props, and ensure the stage is in good working order.

You don’t have to, I suppose, but if you don’t my being here will continue to cause issues for your play.
#COMMENT#
If you want a successful performance, you’ll be helping me regardless.

#COMMENT#
It’s settled then! Oh thank you!
#COMMENT#
And I’ll be here, of course. I don’t suppose there would be anywhere else I would be.
#COMMENT#
Remember, speak to your cast. They’ll tell you if anything needs to be found or repaired, and you’ll likely improve their moods by listening to them.
#COMMENT#
I certainly have the utmost faith in you. Of course, you are also my only option, so it isn’t as if I have much choice… But I’m certain you’ll do just a grand job!
