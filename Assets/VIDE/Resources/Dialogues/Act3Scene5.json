In a stunning performance, the Avalon Community Theatre\u2019s rendition of A Christmas Carol has brought new life to what many had written off as an old box of memories. Since burning down in the 1950s, Avalon Community Theatre has not had a director and cast so dedicated, nor a performance so successful. Thomas Bristol, the theatre\u2019s current owner and the actor playing Ebenezer Scrooge commented that such a successful performance wouldn\u2019t have been possible without their director. We\u2019ve also learned that McKenzie Alondra - the play\u2019s Mrs. Cratchit - has been approached by numerous Broadway talent agencies. Daniel Rossi, perhaps better known as Mr. Bob Cratchit, has been accepted to Northwestern University\u2019s performing arts program for his performance. Samantha Hooper, her uncle Thomas reports, is simply excited to star in her elementary school\u2019s theatre production of Goldilocks and the Three Bears later this year. We at The Avalon are happy to report that with the success of A Christmas Carol, it seems the director has managed to put Avalon Community Theatre back on the map, making it a destination location for all those serious about the performing arts.","pd_2_com_0extraD":"ExtraData","pd_2_com_0showmore":false,"pd_2_com_0visible":true,"pd_2_com_0audio":"","pd_2_com_0sprite":"","pd_isp_3":false,"pd_rect_3":[1170,-210],"pd_comSize_3":1,"pd_ID_3":3,"pd_pTag_3":"","pd_sprite_3":"","pd_expand_3":false,"pd_vars3":0,"pd_3_com_0iSet":-1,"pd_3_com_0oAns":-1,"pd_3_com_0oAct":-1,"pd_3_com_0text":"3 STARS\n\nHumdrum performance at Avalon Community Theatre falls on deaf ears. In a mundane performance, the Avalon Community Theatre\u2019s rendition of A Christmas Carol failed to excite, though many families still claimed to have enjoyed their experience attending. Since burning down in the 1950s, Avalon Community Theatre has not had a successful performance, and this director\u2019s small-cast A Christmas Carol encountered lukewarm reception. Thomas Bristol, the theatre\u2019s current owner and the actor playing Ebenezer Scrooge, commented that the performance would likely have done better if the director had put in more effort with the entire cast. We\u2019ve also learned that McKenzie Alondra - the play\u2019s Mrs. Cratchit - continues to audition for any part that comes her way, hoping for her big break. Daniel Rossi, perhaps better known as Mr. Bob Cratchit, refused to comment on his plans for the future, except to vehemently point out they wouldn\u2019t involve acting. Samantha Hooper, her uncle Thomas reports, is simply excited to be one of the bears in her elementary school\u2019s theatre production of Goldilocks and the Three Bears later this year. We at The Avalon are say to say that it doesn\u2019t look like this director was able to put Avalon Community Theatre back on the map as a destination for those interested in the performing arts, but the theatre continues to struggle onward in hopes the next production will be better than the last.","pd_3_com_0extraD":"ExtraData","pd_3_com_0showmore":false,"pd_3_com_0visible":true,"pd_3_com_0audio":"","pd_3_com_0sprite":"","pd_isp_4":false,"pd_rect_4":[1580,-210],"pd_comSize_4":1,"pd_ID_4":4,"pd_pTag_4":"","pd_sprite_4":"","pd_expand_4":false,"pd_vars4":0,"pd_4_com_0iSet":-1,"pd_4_com_0oAns":-1,"pd_4_com_0oAct":-1,"pd_4_com_0text":"1 STAR\n\nOverdone play sends Avalon Community Theatre further into the past. In a lackluster performance, the Avalon Community Theatre\u2019s rendition of A Christmas Carol has proven that some relics should remain in the past. Since burning down in the 1950s, Avalon Community Theatre has not had a successful production, and this performance continued to disappoint. Thomas Bristol, the theatre\u2019s current owner and a washed-up actor trying to reclaim his glory in the role of Ebenezer Scrooge, angrily commented that such a dreadful performance was the fault of poor direction. We\u2019ve also learned that McKenzie Alondra - the play\u2019s Mrs. Cratchit - has been rejected by numerous talent agencies, and mentioned in tears that she may as well give up acting forever. Daniel Rossi, perhaps better known as Mr. Bob Cratchit, has not been seen since his debut and has been reported missing by the boy\u2019s family. Samantha Hooper, her uncle Thomas reports, has forgone acting in favor of softball practice. We at The Avalon are sorry to say that with this disastrous performance, the Avalon Community Theatre has declared bankruptcy. It seems the next time families wish to spend a day at the theatre in this town, they\u2019ll have to see a
